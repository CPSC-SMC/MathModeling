# 
# Define and apply functions
# 

# 0. import numpy and pyplot



# 1. Create an array X of values between 0 and 2 with numpy.linspace(...). Use num=21.




# 2. Define a function that returns m*x+b. Make b and m the 2nd and 3rd inputs to the function




# 3. Plot this line. Use a slope of 0.5 and an intercept of -1




# 4. Define a function that returns the exponential of sqrt x




# 5. Plot this curve 





# 6. Define a piecewise function which has three pieces:
#       cos(x) when x < pi
#       (x-pi)**2 - 1 when pi < x < 5
#       log(x) when x >=5


# 7. Use list comprehension to create the y-values


# 8. plot the piecewise function
