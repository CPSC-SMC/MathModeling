# 
# Define and apply functions
# 

# 0. import numpy and pyplot


# 1. Define a function that returns the exponential of sqrt x


# 2. Define another function that returns m*x+b. Make b and m the 2nd and 3rd inputs to the function


# 3. Create an array X of values between 0 and 2 with numpy.linspace(...). Use num=21.



# 4. Plot each of these functions. Use a slope of 0.5 and an intercept of -1



# 5. Define a piecewise function which has three pieces:
#       cos(x) when x < pi
#       (x-pi)**2 - 1 when pi < x < 5
#       log(x) when x >=5
