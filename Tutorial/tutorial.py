# Python and NumPy tutorial

# 1. import the numpy and matplotlib libraries


# 2. create a numpy array called x containing values from 0 to 2pi using np.linspace


# 3. create another numpy array of the sines of x


# 4. close any existing plots using pyplot.close()


# 5. plot sin(x) using these two arrays using pyplot.plot(...)
# make sure to include a label



# 6. adjust the axis dimensions to fit the domain and range using pyplot.xlim(...)
#     and pyplot.ylim(...)


# 7. add a legend to your plot with pyplot.legend(loc='xxxx') 


# 8. add a grid to your plot with pyplot.grid()



# 9. add a title, x-axis label and y-axis label to your plot





#10. add a plot of cos(x) in a different color


#11. print the element-wise product of x and y


#12. print the dot-product of x and y


#13. print twice the element-wise product of y and cos(x)


#14. plot twice the element-wise product of y and cos(x)


#15. store a matrix that has y as one row and sin(x**2) as another row
#    use np.array in the variable A, note x**p is x raised to the p power



#16. print the transpose of this matrix A.T


#17. plot x vs. the transpose of A
